11/11/2013 - 12/15/2014



A) What to Avoid ? 




-> 5 year should not be a drop (end point > start point in the period):
	-> 5  year (go by percentile as well... to endure stable pattern; point should be in the middle 40th-60th percentile ?)



-> 1 year must not be decreasing, but the increase % should be low:


-> MA 52 must be uppity (or not down)


-> Monitor Magintitude of Change... should be not huge change


-> monitor huge spikes --> avoid recent spikes :
	-> MAX and MIN should not differ by huge amount (Range)
	-> MA(52) is on upward (for a period of a month minimum)
	-> MA(50) > MA(200)


# MA 52 approaching MA 200





Paramters:
MA 30
MA 50
MA 200

>  % Change 1 Month ? by how much ? 10-5-1?
>  % Change 3 month ?
>  % Change 1 year (must increase)

>  MA 50 how much it differs from MA 200 (percentage?) MA GAP





## Calculations:

# sort by date ascending
# take a point (one day data), then check if it has:

1- previous 199 points before it? (lower than)
2- previous 50 points before it? (lower than)
3- If yes, then include in calculations
